    <h1>DIY Kitchen Fermentation Machine</h1>

      Modern professional kitchens frequently rely on low‑temperature, controlled environments for fermentation, curing, and dehydration. While commercial fermentation cabinets and dehydrators are precise, they are also expensive.

      From an engineering standpoint, a discarded personal mini fridge is an excellent starting platform: it already provides insulation, a sealed enclosure, shelving, and a compressor system that can be repurposed or bypassed. Unlike conventional cooking, airflow and humidity become dominant variables.

      The key insight is that chefs are not using magic equipment — they are using well‑controlled thermodynamics. Once temperature, humidity, and airflow are understood, the rest is implementation detail. Fermentation generally requires minimal airflow and high relative humidity, whereas dehydration demands slow but continuous airflow to remove moisture. A fridge cabinet can support both modes with minor modifications.
    <div class="note">
      Humidity management depends largely on process selection. Fermentation can often rely on passive humidity retention within the sealed cabinet, optionally supplemented by a water tray. Dehydration, by contrast, relies on continuous moisture removal via airflow. While humidity sensors are not strictly required, inexpensive digital sensors can provide valuable feedback and improve repeatability.

      In a DIY context, this workflow is easily replicated by vacuum sealing ingredients externally and placing the sealed bags into the temperature-controlled cabinet. This approach significantly expands the system’s capabilities without adding internal complexity.

      Construction requires precise measurement and tensioning: each cord must be tightened just enough to hold the compression elements in position without deforming them. Once assembled, the table’s stability comes from the continuous interplay of these opposing forces.

      While the design may look delicate, the combination of rigid wood and taut cord creates a surprisingly robust structure that can support small everyday objects reliably. The main <u>Issue</u> for me here is probably the curing time of Wood Glue (i just want to finish this directly! loll)
