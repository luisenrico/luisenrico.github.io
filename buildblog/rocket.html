      <h2 id="rocket">Water Rocket</h2>
      <p>
        Every competition has different constraints, bottles, rules, wind, and judges. What matters is the logic behind the system — once you understand that, you can redesign it however you want. This rocket worked reliably because the physics cooperated, not because parts were glued in a specific order
      
      <div class="figure">

        <br>
        A 60 cm water rocket launched at ~40 psi is built as a <strong>two-stage passive recovery system</strong>. When the water is exhausted, the rocket <strong>separates into two bodies</strong>. The egg-containing section naturally flips 180° due to mass distribution, making parachute deployment trivial. Both sections carry parachutes.<br>
        Deployment is assisted — not forced — by airflow using a small vent that exploits pressure differences (Bernoulli behavior). The egg survives because it is isolated, not restrained, and allowed to decelerate gently.
        <br>
        That’s the whole system. Everything else is implementation detail. 
      
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Note!</strong>
        This rocket works because it respects physics instead of fighting it. No timers. No triggers. Just airflow, inertia, mass, and gravity. . . . doing exactly what they always do. Build like a chef. Taste, adjust, iterate.
        <br>
      </div>
      <br>
        That’s how the egg survives.  
      </p>
    
      <h2> Think in systems, not parts</h2>
      <p>
        The rocket is not one object. It is:
        <ul>
          <li>A propulsion (water + pressure)</li>
          <li>A payload body (egg + stability mass)</li>
          <li>A separation interface (passive, no triggers)</li>
          <li>Two independent recovery systems</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        once you stop thinking of it as "a bottle with fins", the design becomes obvious (atleast for me! :D )
        <br>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Passive mid-air separation (The most important feature)</h2>
      <p>
        As soon as the water is fully expelled, thrust drops to zero almost instantly. At that moment:
        <ul>
          <li>Internal pressure collapses</li>
          <li>Acceleration stops</li>
          <li>Inertia differences dominate</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This is where separation happnes.
        <br><br>
        Now, why does the separation works without mechanisms?
        <br>
        The payload (egg) section is heavier and forward-loaded. The propulsion section is lighter and rear-heavy. when the thrust ends:
        <ul>
          <li>The connection between them no longer experiences compressive force</li>
          <li>Air drag immediately begins to pull them apart</li>
          <li>No springs, no explosives, no timers</li>
        </ul>
        The rocket wants to separate. You simply allow it to. And by the way, this is not staging. . its permission
      </p>
    
      <h2>The 180 degree flip is not an accident - it's designed</h2>
      <p>
        Once separated, the egg section flips nose-down almost immediately. Why?
        <ul>
          <li>The egg is the dominant mass</li>
          <li>Drag acts behind the center of mass</li>
          <li>Gravity finishes the job</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This flip is critical because:
        <ul>
          <li>The parachute is now trailing naturally</li>
          <li>No ejection force is needed</li>
          <li>Tangling probability drops drastically</li>
        </ul>
        In other words: orientation solves deployment
      </p>
    
      <h2>Bernoulli-assisted parachute deployment</h2>
      <p>
        Each section contains a parachute that is lightly retained, not locked. <br>
        A small vent hole exists in the parachute compartment. Its purpose is not pressure equalization — it is <strong>pressure exploitation</strong>.<br>
        When air moves rapidly around the rocket body:
        <ul>
          <li>Pressure outside the hole drops</li>
          <li>Pressure inside the compartment remains higher</li>
          <li>The parachute fabric is gently pulled outward</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This effect becomes strongest:
        <ul>
          <li>at burnout (sudden airflow change)</li>
          <li>During the flip</li>
          <li>As descent begins</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        the hole does not "push" the parachute out. It <strong>removes resistance</strong>

        <div class="note">
          That's the difference between control and cooperation
        </div>
      </p>
      
      <h2>What Actually needs tuning! (and what doesn't)</h2>
      <p>
        Tuning is subjective. for instance, have two parachutes for both separated bodies. just for aerodynamic hygiene (no body free-fall),<br> 
        The other is egg protection - any protection works btw. just the key principle of, the egg must not touch hard structure as this turns a sharp impact into a long deceleration. that's why tissue, foam, sponge, cotton all work!<br>
        Some example that needs tuning base on my experience are:
        <ul>
          <li>Mass distribution (as this controls the flip)</li>
          <li>Vent hole size (this controls deployment timing)</li>
          <li>Parachute packing friction</li>
        </ul>  
        <br>
        then, what does NOT need tuning:
        <ul>
          <li>Exact cushion material, fancy mechanims, perfect symmetry.</li>
        </ul>
        IF your design require precision machining, you missed the point.
      </p>
    
      <h2>How to modify this design intelligently</h2>
      <p>
        Want changes? Change the <strong>Effects</strong>, not parts.
        <br>
        Example are:
        <ul>
          <li>Want earlier deployment? Increase airflow acccess or reduce retention</li>
          <li>Want faster flip? Move mass forward</li>
          <li>want slower descent? increase canopy area, not line length</li>
        </ul>
      <div class="note">
        Every modification should answer one question: "What physical behavior am i changing?"
      </div>
        If you can't answer that, dont build it.

      <h2 id="pad">Water Rocket Launcher Pad</h2>
      <p>
        Of all the water-rocket launch pad designs on the internet — from backyard DIY rigs up to research papers. .  . The <a href="https://www.instructables.com/PVC-Water-Rocket-Launch-Pad-With-Gardena-Connector/">PVC Water Rocket Launch Pad with Gardena Connector</a> stands out as the <strong>cream of the crop</strong>!
        <br>
        Why?
        <br>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/pad.gif" alt="Launch!!">
        <div class="caption">
            This design provides a simple, safe, repeatable, and fairly high-performance launch pad ideal for hobby water rockets!
        </div>
      </div>
        <br>  
        Because it solves the core challenges of water rocket launching with elegant simplicity and reliable performance; a pressure-rated quick-connect that both seals and releases cleanly, a sturdy PVC framework that keeps rockets straight, and a built-in pressurization path that lets you pump up the rocket without fiddling under pressure. Instead of jury-rigged clamps or finicky cable-ties, this design uses parts engineered for pressure and fast release, resulting in a launch system that is safer, more consistent, easier to build, and easier to use than almost any other you’ll find online.
        <br>  
      </p>
    
      <h2>Why this design works?</h2>
      <p>
        At its core, a water rocket launcher must satisfy a few critical requirements:
        <ul>
          <li>Hold the rocket securely while pressurizing</li>
          <li>seal the pressure so tha air/water doesn't leak</li>
          <li>Release the rocket reliably at a chosen moment</li>
          <li>Keep the rocket stable and vertical for a straight launch</li>
          <li>Be safe, portable, and relatively easy to build</li>
        </ul>
        This particular PVC + Gardena design addresses each of those beautifully with simple parts and clever geometry.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Robust Pressure Connection: Gardena Quick-Connect</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of homemade clamps or the traditional Clark cable-tie release(Which often leaks!), this design uses a standard Gardena garden hose quick-connect (EVEN ANY OTHER GARDEN HOSE QUICK CONNECT THAT YOU CAN BUY LOCALLY WILL DO AS WELL!) fitting as the core of the pressurized connection.
        <br>
        why this matters?
        <ul>
          <li>Pre-engineered sealing system: Gardena connectors are meant for holding pressurized water in garden systems. That means they are built to hold pressure and seal air/water reliably without DIY tricks</li>
          <li>Easy quick release: the collar on the connector naturally releases when pulled. . . no tricky clamp adjustments or fragile zip-tie tricks. This makes the launch action clean and dependable.</li>
          <li>Compatible with hose and pump installation: The design embeds a hose and inner pump hose + presta valve right inside the PVC structure to pump air into the rocket while its on the pad. . . so you can pressurize without moving the rocket off the launch tube.</li>
        </ul>
        In other words, the Gardena part serves as both the air delivery system and the hold-down release in one unit - much simplre than mechanical latches or cable tie hooks.
      </p>
    
      <h2>PVC Framework Provides Structure and Stability</h2>
      <p>
        The PVC pieces, connectors, and corks form a tall rail/frame that keeps the rocket vertical. Now, why vertical matters?
        <br>
        When the rocket is launched, most of the initial thrust comes from downward-expelled wter and air. If the rocket isn't straight, that force can veer off, lowering altitude adn increasing unpredictability. A straight launch increases altitude and safety.
        <br>
        The design uses:
        <ul>
          <li>PVC pipe as the tall, rigid rail (guides the rocket)</li>
          <li>O-rings and adjustable base spacers to center the rocket against the rail</li>
          <li>Eyelets/cord lines to help keep the rocket aligned but not overyly constrained (so release is clean)</li>
        </ul>
        The modular frame also makes the launcher portable and stable -- light enough to carry and can be staked into the ground securely with tent pegs.
      </p>

      <h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
      <p>
        Behind the scenes, this project moved through four tightly connected stages: <strong>CAD</strong>, <strong>Simulation</strong>, <strong>Physical construction</strong>, <strong>Teamwork</strong>. 
        <br>
        Interestingly, if the launcher itself isn’t stable, the rocket doesn’t really fly upward at all—it barely leaves the ground. It’s a small detail that’s easy to overlook, but it quietly reminds us how much the fundamentals matter. When things work, it’s tempting to take them for granted.
        <br>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/stability.png" alt="stability!!">
        <div class="caption">
          stable vs unstable rocket launch conditions
      </div>
        The launcher was first modeled in CAD to lock down dimensions, tolerances, and part interfaces, ensuring it is aligned exactly as intended before anything was built.
        <br><br>
        A simplified 2D simulation followed to analyze the core physics. Stripping the system down to its essentials to verify that the design logic matched theoretical expectations.
        <br><br>
        The concept was then recreated in Unity3D, where timing, release behavior, and motion could be visualized dynamically, helping confirm stability and launch behavior in a more intuitive, interactive way.
        <br><br>
        Finally, the real-world build validated all prior steps: 
        <ul>
          <li>The launcher assembled cleanly</li>
          <li>held the pressure reliably</li>
          <li>behaved almost identically to the simulations</li>
          <li>iterations of the adapter, where the only challenge so far.</li>
        </ul>
