    This spaghetti bridge uses a simple Warren truss with short, bundled compression members and light tension members to reliably carry heavy loads far beyond what most designs achieve.

  <h2>The 50‑kg Spaghetti Bridge That Wins</h2>
  <p>
    This chapter distills everything that actually matters when building a competition‑grade spaghetti bridge.
    No tricks, no aesthetics, no unnecessary theory  —  just decisions that reliably let a bridge carry 50 kg and beyond.

    <br>
    A spaghetti bridge is an architectural model of a bridge, made of uncooked spaghetti or other hard, dry, straight noodles. 
    Bridges are constructed for both educational experiments and competitions. 
    The aim is usually to construct a bridge with a specific quantity of materials over a specific span, that can sustain a load. Using only Super Glue and Stick Glue for bonding agent.
  
  <div class="note">
    <strong>However!</strong>
    What we should do is to Intentionally create sacrificial members that fail first in non-critical locations, allowing the load to reroute without catastrophic collapse.
  </div>  
    <br><br>
    <u>1. Choose on structure and commit to it</u>!
    <br>
    Use a straight Warren truss with equal‑sized triangles. This geometry naturally balances forces and avoids long, weak members. Fancy shapes introduce uncertainty; repetition creates predictability. Predictability is how bridges win.
    <br><br>
    <u>2. Treat compression as the enemy</u>
    <br>
    Spaghetti fails in compression by buckling, not by crushing. Any member under compression must be short and thick. If a compression member is longer than a finger, bundle it.

    Bundling must be three‑dimensional — triangular or box‑like. Moving material away from the center dramatically increases buckling resistance.
    <br><br>
    <u>3. Keep Tension members light</u>
    Spaghetti performs well in tension. Use single sticks for tension members. Bundling here wastes weight and gives no advantage. A winning bridge is heavy only where it must be.
    <br><br>
    <u>4. Build joints like structural elements</u>
    Most bridges fail at joints, not members. Every joint must:
    <ul>
      <li>Have roughened spahetti ends</li>
      <li>use the prescribed glue's</li>
      <li>Overlap members by atleast 10-15 mm</li>
    </ul>
    A joint should look like a small node, not two sticks touching.

    <br><br>
    <u>Now the non-obious trick!</u> 
    The bridge is not failing at 50 kg but it's failing earlier, adn the rest is just delayed collapse. what actually happens is this:
    <ul>
      <li>At 60 - 80% of max load, one compression member micro-buckles</li>
      <li>This causes a force distribution across the truss</li>
      <li>Other members quietly take overload they were never designed for</li>
      <li>The final "snap" is just the moment the structure runs out of redundancy, not strength</li>
    </ul>
    Thus, A bridge that looks overbuilt in one or two critical compression members will outperform a uniformly strong bridge  —  even if the total spaghetti mass is the same.
