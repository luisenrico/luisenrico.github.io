      A tensegrity table functions through a deliberate separation of compression and tension elements rather than through continuous load paths typical of conventional furniture.

    <h2 id="Concept">The Concept</h2>
    <p>
      A tensegrity table achieves its striking “floating” appearance by balancing compression and tension. The wooden pieces act as rigid compression elements, while the cords—commonly braided nylon or Dyneema—serve as tension members.

      Instead of supporting the top directly from below, the table relies on these cords to maintain its shape and stability. When a lightweight object, like a phone, is placed on the surface, the load is distributed through the compressed wooden elements and countered by the tension in the cords, keeping the top elevated and steady.    
  
    <div class="note">
      The result is a visually minimal, elegant structure that appears to defy gravity while remaining fully functional for everyday small items.

      Building a tensegrity table starts with careful selection of materials. The wood must be stiff enough to resist bending under light loads, and the cords need low stretch to preserve the geometry over time. Eyelets or small hooks are often used to guide the cords and anchor them securely.

      Construction requires precise measurement and tensioning: each cord must be tightened just enough to hold the compression elements in position without deforming them. Once assembled, the table’s stability comes from the continuous interplay of these opposing forces.

      While the design may look delicate, the combination of rigid wood and taut cord creates a surprisingly robust structure that can support small everyday objects reliably.
